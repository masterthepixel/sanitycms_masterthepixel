Branch: feature/migration/sanity-to-md/mig-002
Priority: High  
Estimate: 12–20 hours → **Completed Feb 13, 2026**
Assignee: @mastethepixel — frontend / PO collaborator

## ✅ COMPLETION STATUS
**Result**: 3 pilot pages (home, about, services) successfully converted from Sanity pageBuilder to MDX with full component rendering.

**Proof of Work**:
- [content/pages/home.mdx](content/pages/home.mdx) - Hero, FeatureGrid, Testimonial components  
- [content/pages/about.mdx](content/pages/about.mdx) - Hero component
- [content/pages/services.mdx](content/pages/services.mdx) - Hero, Services components
- [src/components/mdx/](src/components/mdx/) - MDX wrapper components created
- **Visual parity confirmed**: Components render identically to production Sanity version

## Goal
Migrate three representative Page Builder pages (hero, feature grid, testimonial) into MDX and implement MDX wrappers for reused block components so the front-end UI remains unchanged.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria - ACHIEVED
- 3 pilot pages render identically when served from MDX ✅ **CONFIRMED**
- No Sanity runtime calls for pilot pages ✅ **CONFIRMED**

# MIG-008 — Sanity cleanup & archive Studio

Branch: feature/migration/sanity-to-md/mig-008
Priority: Low
Estimate: 4–8 hours
Assignee: @infra (suggested) — cleanup & archive owner

## Goal
Remove Sanity runtime, archive studio files and update docs & CI env vars.

## Acceptance criteria
- `@sanity/*` packages removed from `package.json`
- No Sanity runtime code left in `src/` that runs in production
- `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` removed from CI/Vercel envs

## Developer tasks (developer-ready, assignable)
1. Remove runtime deps (1–2h)
   - Remove `@sanity/*`, `next-sanity`, `@portabletext/react` from `package.json` and run `pnpm install`.
   - Run full build and test `pnpm run build && pnpm test`.
2. Archive Studio (0.5–1h)
   - Move `studio/` to `archive/studio/` or tag it as read-only in the repo and add archival notes in docs.
3. CI & env cleanup (0.5h)
   - Remove `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` from GitHub Actions / Vercel / CI env variables and update README.
4. Final verification (0.5h)
   - Confirm no runtime `sanity` imports remain (search codebase) and run `npx tsc --noEmit`.
